#model(string)
ID of the model to use. See the model endpoint compatibility table for details on which models work with the Chat API.

#n
integer or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. 
Note that you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

#temperature
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 2. Higher values like 0.8 will make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more focused and deterministic.
We generally recommend altering this or top_p but not both.

#top_p
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 1
An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1 means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered.
We generally recommend altering this or temperature but not both.

#max_tokens
integer or null
Optional
Defaults to inf
The maximum number of tokens to generate in the chat completion.
The total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's context length.

#frequency_penalty(number or null)
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their existing frequency in the text so far, 
decreasing the model's likelihood to repeat the same line verbatim.

#presence_penalty
number or null
Optional
Defaults to 0
Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far, 
increasing the model's likelihood to talk about new topics.
